             <h2><b>BENEFITS OF YOGA THERAPY</b></h2>
        <p class="text-justify new_p"></p>
        <ul>
             <p><li>Yoga therapy is practiced in a wide range of formats. Physical therapists, for example, often implement yoga techniques in their delivery of massage and other treatments. Yoga therapy practice can resemble physical therapy, rehabilitative therapy, and/or psychotherapy. Unlike a standard yoga class, yoga therapy sessions are typically conducted in one-on-one or small group settings. Yoga therapy can be provided as an adjunct therapy to complement other forms of treatment, or it can be used to directly treat a specific issue. Yoga techniques range from simple to advanced, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.</li></p>
            
       </ul> 
       <ul>
              <p><li>Potential benefits from yoga therapy include stress reduction, psychological well-being, improved diet, and efficient functioning of bodily systems. A 2011 qualitative study from Inkanyiso: Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences examined the effects of yoga therapy on anxiety. The findings not only indicated that yoga therapy effectively reduced subjects' anxiety, but improvement across several dimensions of physical and mental health including physicality, relaxation, and mindfulness.</li></p>

        </ul>
              <h2 style="background-color: tan;">Yoga to improve immunity</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><li>Our system is a seamless blend of the body, mind, and spirit. An irregularity in the body affects the mind and similarly, unpleasantness or restlessness in the mind can manifest as an ailment in the body. Yoga poses help massage organs and strengthens muscles while breathing techniques and meditation release stress and improve immunity.</li></p>

        </ul>
             <h2 style="background-color: tan;">Yoga for better flexibility and posture</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><li>Yoga must become a part of your daily routine to get a body that is strong, supple, and flexible. Regular yoga practice stretches and tones the body muscles and also makes them strong. It also helps improve your body posture when you stand, sit, sleep or walk. This would, in turn, help relieve you of body ache due to incorrect posture.</li>

            </p>
        </ul>
             <h2 style="background-color: tan;">Yoga to improve intuition</h2>
        <ul>
               <p><li>Yoga and meditation have the power to improve your intuitive ability so that you spontaneously realize what needs to be done, when and how, to yield positive results. Since Yoga is a continuous process, it is recommended to keep practicing. The deeper you go into yoga practice, the more profound its benefits will be.

                <li>Practicing Yoga helps develop the body and mind, yet is not a substitute for medicine. It is essential to learn and practice yoga under the supervision of a trained Yoga teacher. In case of any medical condition, practice yoga only after consulting your doctor and a Sri Sri Yoga teacher.</li>
